MD5R2OBJ
========

An exercise is decoding some Wolfenstein 2009 geometry files (MD5R and PROCB).  I couldn't find anything out there so I wrote this.  The code was written litterally in a single night, so it's not pretty, but it does convert most static geometry like props and much of the BSP geometry inside of PROCB files.  It does not process the exernal references to place entity models and it doesn't properly handle transforming animated models out of bone space and back to bindpose...  If someone out there cares enough they can take this code and figure it out, but I recommend sharing if you do.
